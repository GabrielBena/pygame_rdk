# Random Dot Kinematogram
a random dot kinematogram implemented in pygame
The RDK is fully customisable, i.e. you can change its colour, size, dot coherence, duration of display etc.
Each frame is written to a numpy array and returned by the RDK object, which makes this implementation
suitable for simulations etc.  

## Install : 

``git clone https://github.com/GabrielBena/pygame_rdk``

``cd pygame_rdk ``

``conda env create -f RDK.yml ``

``conda activate RDK ``

``pip install -e. ``

``pip install git+https://github.com/GabrielBena/custom_heatmap.git``

`` pip install git+https://github.com/GabrielBena/pygame-text.git ``

## Run Experiment 
Experiment with random parameters : 

  -experiment.ipynb
  
Plot polar repartitions of angles, adjust parameters then run experiments : 

  -rdk_histograms.ipynb
  


### Examples
The easiest way to get started is to call the rdk script and play around with different parameters

#### Trials with Fixation
I've also implemented a fixation cross and aperture, as well as a separate class to define trial sequences.
Below is an example:

#### Dot coherence
The coherence of random dot motion, i.e. the percentage of dots moving in the
requested direction, can be varied parametrically.  

**1. Example with coherence of 100%**

**2. Example with coherence of 50%**     
![coher100](gifs/coherence50pcnt.gif)  

**3. Example with 0% coherence**  
![coher100](gifs/coherence0pcnt.gif)


#### Dot size and density
Both the number of dots and their size can be adjusted.

**1. Example with small and many dots**   
![smallandmany](gifs/smallandmany.gif)

**2. Example with few and large dots**    
![fewandlarge](gifs/largeandfew.gif)  

#### Dot speed
You can also change the speed with which dots move over the screen (in terms of pixels per frame)  

**1. Slow dots**

**2. Fast dots**
